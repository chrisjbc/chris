        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm Chris. I am outgoing, steady, good at thinking, with strong self-learning ability and solid professional knowledge. I like to learn something about programming on my own in my spare time, which is a great way for me to learn at my own pace. I also like to play some computer games to relax, and I think combining work and rest is the best way to do it.</p>
        <h1>Achievements</h1>
        <p>I have a strong passion for website design and have gained valuable experience in this field. I won a good ranking in my school's website design interest competition, and I also participated in the official website design of an international game design competition. Through these experiences, I have honed my HTML skills and developed a keen eye for design aesthetics.</p>
